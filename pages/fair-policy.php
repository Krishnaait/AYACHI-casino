                            unpredictable outcomes. Our RNG system:

                        <h3>Slots</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our slot machines use RNG to determine reel outcomes. Each spin is independent and fair. 
                            The probability of each symbol appearing is equal and predetermined. Payout percentages are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>7 (Crown): 100x bet</li>
                            <li>Diamond: 50x bet</li>

                                                <ul>
                            <li>Straight Number Bet: 36:1 payout</li>

                            <li>Range Bet (1-18/19-36): 2:1 payout</li>

                        <h3>Blackjack</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our blackjack game uses RNG for card shuffling and dealing. Each card has an equal probability of being 
                            dealt. The dealer follows strict rules (hits on 16, stands on 17+). Payout odds are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Player Win: 2:1 payout</li>
                            <li>Blackjack: 2.5:1 payout</li>
                            <li>Push: Bet returned</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Poker</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our 5-card draw poker uses RNG for card shuffling and dealing. Each card has an equal probability of 
                            being dealt. Hand rankings are determined fairly and transparently.
